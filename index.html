            was a man of profound intellect and an ardent seeker of truth. From
            a young age, he displayed a deep curiosity for literature,
            philosophy, and spirituality. His love for books and quest for

            journey under Shahab's guidance. Embracing Sufism, he explored the
            deeper dimensions of existence and began a lifelong quest for
            self-discovery and enlightenment.
